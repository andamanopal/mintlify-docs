# Site Configuration Basics

Properly configuring Alto CERO 2.0 for a specific site is essential for optimal performance. This guide covers the basics of site configuration, including file structure, key parameters, and best practices.

## Configuration File Structure

Site configurations in Alto CERO 2.0 are stored in YAML files within the `site_configs` directory. Each site has its own configuration file, typically named after the site (e.g., `site1.yaml`).

```
site_configs/
├── site1.yaml
├── site2.yaml
└── templates/
    ├── default.yaml
    ├── office_building.yaml
    └── data_center.yaml
```

## Basic Site Configuration

A site configuration file defines the site details, equipment, and points that Alto CERO 2.0 will monitor and control. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
# Site details
site:
  id: "site1"
  name: "Office Building A"
  location:
    address: "123 Main St, Singapore"
    latitude: 1.3521
    longitude: 103.8198
    timezone: "Asia/Singapore"
  contact:
    name: "John Smith"
    email: "john.smith@example.com"
    phone: "+6512345678"

# Network configuration
network:
  bacnet:
    device_id: 1001
    network_number: 10
    address: "192.168.1.10"
    port: 47808
    bbmd_address: "192.168.1.1"
    bbmd_port: 47808

# Data collection settings
data_collection:
  polling_interval: 300  # seconds
  historian:
    enabled: true
    buffer_size: 10000
    flush_interval: 60  # seconds

# Equipment configuration follows below...
```

## Configuring Equipment

Equipment is defined in the `equipment` section of the configuration file. Each piece of equipment has a type, name, and associated points.

```yaml
equipment:
  - id: "chiller1"
    type: "chiller"
    name: "Chiller 1"
    manufacturer: "Carrier"
    model: "30XA-1152"
    capacity: 1152  # refrigeration tons
    bacnet_device_id: 100
    points:
      - name: "status_read"
        bacnet_object_type: "binary-input"
        bacnet_object_id: 1
        description: "Chiller running status"
        
      - name: "power"
        bacnet_object_type: "analog-input"
        bacnet_object_id: 2
        description: "Power consumption"
        unit: "kW"
        scaling_factor: 1.0
        
      - name: "efficiency"
        bacnet_object_type: "analog-input"
        bacnet_object_id: 3
        description: "Chiller efficiency"
        unit: "kW/RT"
        scaling_factor: 1.0
        
      # ... more points

  - id: "pchp1"
    type: "pchp"
    name: "Primary Chilled Water Pump 1"
    bacnet_device_id: 200
    points:
      # ... pump points
      
  # ... more equipment
```

## Point Configuration

Each point represents a specific data point collected from equipment. Points are configured with the following properties:

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The internal name of the point, matching the schema in `model_schema.yaml`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="bacnet_object_type" type="string" required>
  The BACnet object type (e.g., analog-input, binary-input)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="bacnet_object_id" type="integer" required>
  The BACnet object ID
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  A human-readable description of the point
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="unit" type="string">
  The unit of measurement
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="scaling_factor" type="number">
  A scaling factor to apply to the raw value
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="read_only" type="boolean">
  Whether the point is read-only (default: true)
</ResponseField>

## Control Points

Control points are points that can be written to (e.g., setpoints, control commands). They have additional configuration:

```yaml
- name: "setpoint_write"
  bacnet_object_type: "analog-output"
  bacnet_object_id: 10
  description: "Chilled water temperature setpoint"
  unit: "°C"
  scaling_factor: 1.0
  read_only: false  # This is a writable point
  min_value: 5.0
  max_value: 10.0
  default_value: 6.5
  priority: 8  # BACnet priority
```

## Virtual Points

Virtual points are calculated or derived values that are not directly read from equipment:

```yaml
- name: "efficiency_calculated"
  description: "Calculated efficiency based on power and cooling rate"
  unit: "kW/RT"
  formula: "points.power / points.cooling_rate"
  dependencies:
    - "power"
    - "cooling_rate"
```

## Plant Configuration

The `plant` section defines the overall chiller plant configuration:

```yaml
plant:
  id: "plant1"
  name: "Main Chiller Plant"
  description: "Primary cooling plant for the building"
  equipment:
    chillers:
      - "chiller1"
      - "chiller2"
      - "chiller3"
    pchps:
      - "pchp1"
      - "pchp2"
    schps:
      - "schp1"
      - "schp2"
    cdps:
      - "cdp1"
      - "cdp2"
    cts:
      - "ct1"
      - "ct2"
  design_capacity: 3500  # RT
  design_efficiency: 0.65  # kW/RT
```

## Equipment Relationships

The `relationships` section defines how equipment is connected:

```yaml
relationships:
  - from:
      equipment_id: "chiller1"
      connection_point: "evaporator"
    to:
      equipment_id: "pchp1"
      connection_point: "discharge"
    relationship_type: "water_flow"
    
  - from:
      equipment_id: "chiller1"
      connection_point: "condenser"
    to:
      equipment_id: "cdp1"
      connection_point: "discharge"
    relationship_type: "water_flow"
    
  # ... more relationships
```

## Optimization Settings

The `optimization` section defines settings for the optimization algorithms:

```yaml
optimization:
  enabled: true
  mode: "efficiency"  # efficiency, cost, or balanced
  constraints:
    min_chilled_water_temp: 5.5  # °C
    max_chilled_water_temp: 8.0  # °C
    min_condenser_water_temp: 28.0  # °C
    max_condenser_water_temp: 35.0  # °C
  schedules:
    - name: "Working Hours"
      days:
        - "Monday"
        - "Tuesday"
        - "Wednesday"
        - "Thursday"
        - "Friday"
      start_time: "08:00"
      end_time: "18:00"
      setpoints:
        chilled_water_temp: 6.5  # °C
```

## Alarming Configuration

The `alarms` section defines alarm thresholds and notifications:

```yaml
alarms:
  - point:
      equipment_id: "chiller1"
      point_name: "evap_leaving_water_temperature"
    conditions:
      - type: "lower_threshold"
        severity: "high"
        threshold: 5.0
        message: "Evaporator leaving water temperature below minimum threshold"
      - type: "upper_threshold"
        severity: "medium"
        threshold: 8.0
        message: "Evaporator leaving water temperature above maximum threshold"
    notifications:
      email:
        - "operator@example.com"
      sms:
        - "+6512345678"
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Templates">
    Start with a template configuration file that matches your site type (office building, data center, etc.) and customize as needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Everything">
    Add descriptive comments to your configuration file to explain non-obvious settings and decisions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Consistent Naming">
    Follow a consistent naming convention for equipment IDs and point names to make the configuration more maintainable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple">
    Begin with basic configuration and gradually add more complex features as you verify that the basic functionality works correctly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Validate Configuration">
    Always validate your configuration file using the provided validation script before deploying it.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<ResponseField name="Validation Errors">
  If the validation script reports errors, check the error message for the location of the error in the configuration file and fix it.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Missing Data">
  If data is not being collected for a point, verify that the BACnet object type and ID are correct, and that the equipment is communicating on the network.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Scaling Issues">
  If values seem incorrect, check the scaling factor for the point. Some BACnet devices report values in different units or scales.
